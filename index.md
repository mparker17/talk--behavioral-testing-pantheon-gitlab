# Automated Behavioral Testing on a budget with Pantheon, GitLab CI, and Behat
— with mparker17

<small>Pantheon is one of the cheapest Drupal Software-as-a-Service hosting providers; but even a small team with limited budget can start behavioral testing their Pantheon dev site with GitLab CI and Behat. This presentation will show you how we did it at Brady’s Meat & Deli.</small>

See [the slides](slides.md), [the speaker notes](speaker-notes.md), or [the repository][repo].
