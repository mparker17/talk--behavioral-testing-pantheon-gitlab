<!-- Why. -->

<section>
<section>

## How did this all start?

* Bradys is already using Pantheon for our existing D7 site
* Porting site to D8, finally
* Needed to install [Drupal Commerce][drupal-commerce] for our Turkey Order System
    * Drupal Commerce has non-Drupal dependencies, so needs composer
    * Using Composer on Pantheon breaks automatic updates, is not recommended

[drupal-commerce]: http://drupal.org/project/commerce

</section>
<section>

### How did this all start? (ctd.)

* Researched other hosting providers ([Acquia Cloud][acquia-cloud], [Platform.sh][platformsh-pricing], [Omega8.cc][omega8-pricing], [Contegix][contegix-drupal])
    * [Pantheon][pantheon-pricing] still cheaper by large margin for our use-case
* Reading support pages and forums pointed me to [pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer][example-drops-8-composer]
    * didn't solve the broken automatic updates,
    * is a recommended way of handling custom composer dependencies

## Why Pantheon?

1. I'm the only developer at Brady's, and I'm not a security expert
2. Maintaining our own server would take too much time
3. Specialized Drupal hosting has key features
    * Drupal-tuned application firewall
    * strong control over code
    * automated backups
    * automated error collection and logging

</section>
<section>

## Why Pantheon? (ctd.)

4. Pantheon saves me time
    * competitive price
    * zero-config, free: HTTPS, traffic scaling, <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr>, advanced caching, server-side metrics collection
    * Canadian data residency
    * automated status checks
    * (automatic core updates; but we are no longer using this feature)

</section>
<section>

## Why Gitlab CI?

* Simple pricing scheme ([max 2000 minutes per month][gitlab-pricing], versus [buying "credits"][circleci-pricing] or [max number of users][bitbucket-pricing])
* Useful, clear metrics (cycle time, CI job time, etc.)
* Easy to set up a self-hosted Community Edition instance if I want to stop using gitlab.com
* Other open-source projects I use have started using it ([Drupal.org][drupal-gitlab], [GNOME][gnome-gitlab], [LineageOS][lineage-gitlab], etc.)

## Why Behat?

* Primarily need a way to test for regressions
* Very little custom code on the Bradys site - all behavior in config
* Working configuration already in template Pantheon repo
* Specify behavior with industry-standard [Gherkin][gherkin] <abbr title="Domain Specific Language">DSL</abbr>

# End result

1. When I push to a branch
2. GitLab CI runs in three stages:
    1. Build
        * Deploys to dev with SFTP, runs behat tests on the dev site
    2. Test
        1. PHPCodeSniffer, unit tests
        2. Behat
    3. Cleanup
